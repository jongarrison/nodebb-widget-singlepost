#Nodebb Single Post Widget

NODEBB VERSION NOTE: This widget will not be functional with versions of nodebb less than 0.8.3 because of this
necessary code change in NodeBB:  https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/2e1661a5e8e34803ac89a0a36d3ff55a12b76a2c

This widget allows you to link to an existing post by post id.  This makes it possible to centrally 
edit and maintain the content of widgets that may be displayed in various places throughout your 
NodeBB site.  This makes it possible to use the familiar post editing tools to alter appearance of your
site.

Enjoy!
