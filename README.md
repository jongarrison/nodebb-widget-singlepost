# Nodebb Single Post Widget

> *NODEBB VERSION NOTE:* Should now work with 0.7.x, 0.8.x

This widget allows you to link to an existing post by post id.  This makes it possible to centrally 
edit and maintain the content of widgets that may be displayed in various places throughout your 
NodeBB site.  This makes it possible to use the familiar post editing tools to alter appearance of your
site.

Enjoy!
